- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Asynchronous multi-threaded backup** for higher performance, especially with large or multiple files
- üñ•Ô∏è **Cross-platform**: macOS, Linux, Windows
- üóÇÔ∏è **Custom backup jobs** with unique IDs
- üìù **Configuration and task management** via TOML in user config directory
- üè† Supports `~`, `$HOME`, and relative paths for source and target
- üîÑ **Edit, delete, and list** backup jobs easily
- üóúÔ∏è **Compression support**: `gzip`, `zip`, `sevenz`, `zstd`, `bzip2`, `xz` and `lz4` for files and directories

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```sh
cargo install hbackup
```

### 2. Add one or more jobs

```sh
bk add ~/my_path1/my_file1.txt ~/back
# Add a job with compression
bk add ~/my_path3/my_dir ~/back -c gzip
bk add ~/my_path4/my_dir ~/back -c zip -l best
```

### 3. List all jobs

```sh
bk list
```

### 4. Run backup jobs

- **Run all jobs:**
  
  ```sh
  bk run
  ```

- **Run multiple jobs by ID:**
  
  ```sh
  bk run --id 1
  bk run --id 1,2
  ```

- **Run a one-time backup (without saving as a job):**
  
  ```sh
  bk run ~/my_path/myfile.txt ~/back
  ```

  You can also specify compression for a one-time backup:

  ```sh
  bk run ~/my_path/mydir ~/back -c gzip
  bk run ~/my_path/mydir ~/back -c zip -l best
  ```

### 5. Delete jobs

- **Delete multiple jobs by ID:**

  ```sh
  bk delete --id 1
  bk delete --id 1,2
  ```

- **Delete all jobs:**
  
  ```sh
  bk delete --all
  ```

### 6. Edit a job

Update the source and/or target of a job by its ID:

```sh
bk edit --id 1 --source ~/newfile.txt --target ~/newbackup/
```

### 7. Manage configuration file

- **Show configuration file path:**

  ```sh
  bk config
  ```

- **Backup configuration file:**

  ```sh
  bk config --copy
  ```

- **Reset configuration file (auto-backup before reset):**

  ```sh
  bk config --reset
  ```

- **Rollback to the last backed up configuration file:**

  ```sh
  bk config --rollback
  ```

---

## Compression Support

You can specify compression format (`gzip`, `zip`, `sevenz`, `zstd`, `bzip2` or `lz4`) when **adding** or **running** jobs:

```sh
# Add a job with gzip compression
bk add ~/file.txt ~/back --compression gzip --level fastest
# or a short command line
bk add ~/file.txt ~/back -c gzip -l fastest

# One-time backup with compression
bk run ~/my_path/mydir ~/back -c gzip
```

- Compression works for both files and directories.
- Output files will have `gz`, `zip`, `7z`, `zst`, `bzip2`, `xz` or `lz4` extensions.
- If no compression is specified, files are copied as-is.
